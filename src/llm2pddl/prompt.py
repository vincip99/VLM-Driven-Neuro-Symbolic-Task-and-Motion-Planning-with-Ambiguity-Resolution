Starting from a PDDL domain template, you are allowed to modify the template using the following two python function interfaces:
```python
add_or_update_predicates(predicates: List[str])
modify_action(action_name: str, new_preconditions: List[str], new_effects: List[str])
```

An example of above functions applied to an example PDDL domain template is as follows:

{context_shot_example}

Target Domain Description:
{target_domain_nl}

Target Problem PDDL:
{target_problem_pddl}

Now, your task is to complete the following PDDL template by generating necessary predicates and action preconditions and effects:

{target_domain_template_pddl}

You must never modify action parameters, and you are only allowed to use the above two function interfaces to modify the template.

# Second prompt as an example of a domain + problem + generated PDDL
BLOCKS_WORLD_EXAMPLE = """Example Domain Description:
```markdown
The robot has four actions: pickup, putdown, stack and unstack. The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.
The actions defined in this domain include:
- pickup:  allows the arm to pick up a block from the table if it is clear and the arm is empty. After the pickup action, the arm will be holding the block, and the block will no longer be on the table or clear.
- putdown: allows the arm to put down a block on the table if it is holding a block. After the putdown action, the arm will be empty, and the block will be on the table and clear.
- stack: allows the arm to stack a block on top of another block if the arm is holding the top block and the bottom block is clear. After the stack action, the arm will be empty, the top block will be on top of the bottom block, and the bottom block will no longer be clear.
- unstack: allows the arm to unstack a block from on top of another block if the arm is empty and the top block is clear. After the unstack action, the arm will be holding the top block, the top block will no longer be on top of the bottom block, and the bottom block will be clear.
```

Example Problem PDDL:
```pddl

    )
    (:goal
      (and
        (on b4 b3)
      )
    )

CRITICAL RULES FOR GENERAL PDDL PROBLEM GENERATION:
1. Always output valid PDDL problem code enclosed within ```pddl ... ``` code blocks.
2. Copy the `:objects` block directly from the provided Problem PDDL Template into your output, preserving all object names and their type declarations (`- <type>`). Do NOT flatten or remove type declarations (`- <type>`).
3. Strictly adhere to the predicate signatures, argument types, and parameter ordering defined in the Domain PDDL for all `:init` and `:goal` statements.
4. Do NOT introduce or hallucinate predicate names, functions, or object types that are not explicitly declared in the Domain PDDL.
5. Do NOT prefix ground object constants with question marks ('?')."""
